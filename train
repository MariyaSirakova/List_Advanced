You will receive a number representing the number of wagons a train has. Create a list (train) with the given length 
containing only zeros. Until you receive the command "End", you will receive some of the following commands:
• "add {people}" – you should add the number of people in the last wagon
• "insert {index} {people}" - you should add the number of people at the given wagon
• "leave {index} {people}" - you should remove the number of people from the wagon. 

length_train = int(input())
train = [0] * length_train
command = input().split()

while command[0] != 'End':
    if command[0] == 'add':
        people = int(command[1])
        train[-1] += people
    elif command[0] == 'insert':
        index = int(command[1])
        people = int(command[2])
        train[index] += people
    elif command[0] == 'leave':
        index = int(command[1])
        people = int(command[2])
        train[index] -= people

    command = input().split()

print(train)
