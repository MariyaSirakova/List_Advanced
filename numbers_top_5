Read from the console a single line holding space-separated integers.

1. Print the above-described numbers on a single line, space-separated. 
2. If less than 5 numbers hold the property mentioned above, print less than 5 numbers. 
3. Print "No" if no numbers hold the above property.

numbers = [int(n) for n in input().split()]
TOP_FIVE = 5
average_value = int(sum(numbers) / len(numbers))
average_numbers = sorted([n for n in numbers if n > average_value])

if not average_numbers:
    print('No')
else:
    for x in range(TOP_FIVE):
        if average_numbers:
            print(average_numbers.pop(), end=" ")
