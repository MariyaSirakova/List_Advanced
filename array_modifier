You are given an array with integers. Write a program to modify the elements after receiving the following commands:
"swap {index1} {index2}" takes two elements and swap their places.
"multiply {index1} {index2}" takes element at the 1st index and multiply it with the element at 2nd index. Save the product at the 1st index.
"decrease" decreases all elements in the array with 1.

numbers = [int(n) for n in input().split()]
command = input()

while command != 'end':
    command = command.split()
    action = command[0]

    if action == 'swap':
        index_1, index_2 = int(command[1]), int(command[2])
        numbers[index_1], numbers[index_2] = numbers[index_2], numbers[index_1]

    elif action == 'multiply':
        index_1, index_2 = int(command[1]), int(command[2])
        numbers[index_1] = numbers[index_1] * numbers[index_2]

    elif action == 'decrease':
        numbers = [n - 1 for n in numbers]

    command = input()

print(*numbers, sep=", ")
